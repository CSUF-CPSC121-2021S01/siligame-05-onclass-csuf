# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.

To summarize things, the only thing I did was removing the dead objects from game. Before, in milestone 4, the erased opponents and stuff would linger on the game screen invisible, now, they are gone for real.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.

The biggest challenge was passing the unit tests, it wants me to do things in a specific way, when one of my approach was also great. Unfortunately the unit test was not written to handle my thought process.

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?

I learned that forensics is imperative to success. If I did not investigate unittest.cc, I would still be stuck on that one function thinking about what I did wrong. As someone who pursues cybersecurity, I say this is the single most important thing I learned the entire semester.
